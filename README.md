# My Portfolio
A personal portfolio website to showcase my projects and skills.

## Introduction
This portfolio website is designed with a mobile-first approach to ensure a seamless experience on all devices. It features fully responsive layouts, supporting both light and dark mode, so visitors can view it comfortably in any environment.  

I chose **React** to refresh and practice a technology I truly enjoy working with, allowing for a dynamic and component-based structure. **Tailwind CSS** was selected to learn a modern utility-first CSS framework and streamline styling while keeping the design clean and maintainable.
