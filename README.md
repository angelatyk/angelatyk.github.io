# My Portfolio
A personal portfolio website to showcase my projects and skills.

## Introduction
This portfolio website is designed with a mobile-first approach to provide a seamless experience on all devices. It supports both light and dark mode, so visitors can view it comfortably in any environment.

I chose **React** to refresh and practice a technology I truly enjoy working with, allowing for a dynamic, component-based structure. I also intentionally chose **Tailwind CSS**, despite having no prior experience with it, as a genuine learning opportunity to explore a modern utility-first CSS framework while keeping the design clean and maintainable.
