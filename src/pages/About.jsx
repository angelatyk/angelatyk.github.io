				<p>
					I’ve been building things my whole life, from Lego castles as a kid to full-stack applications today. I still chase that same satisfaction I felt back then, the moment when everything clicks
					into place and just works. That spark for creating and problem-solving still drives everything I do.
				</p>
				<p>
					With over 11 years in full-stack development, I’ve honed enterprise Java/J2EE, ventured into modern front-end with React and Node.js, and explored the exciting world of AI/ML using Python,
					TensorFlow, Keras, and Scikit-learn.
				</p>
				<p>
					I’m curious by nature, collaborative by choice, and happiest when I’m learning something new. Whether it’s building a feature, training a model, or brainstorming with a team, I’m always
					looking for the next meaningful challenge.
